As a student, I noticed how confusing it can be to apply for travel discounts online. This project explores the GOV.UK Design System and frontend tools by building a prototype for a student travel discount service

It focuses on:

Implementing accessible, user-friendly forms and navigation

Using official GOV.UK components, typography, and colors

Experimenting with front-end-first prototypes for government services

The idea came from my own experience as a student trying to save money on travel, combining practical need with learning about government service design

This repo demonstrates GOV.UK frontend skills, accessibility awareness, and prototyping experienceâ€”ideal for showing employers both technical and user-centered design abilities
